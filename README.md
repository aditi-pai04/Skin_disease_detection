# Skin Disease Detection

This project aims to develop a machine learning-based diagnostic system for skin diseases using a mixed-model approach. The system combines the strengths of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and ensemble methods, such as random forest classifiers, to provide accurate and reliable skin disease diagnoses.

## Features

1. **Image-Based Diagnosis**: Leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for recognizing disease from skin images.
2. **Symptom-Based Diagnosis**: Utilizes ensemble methods, such as random forest classifiers, for diagnosing diseases based on symptoms.
3. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for inputting skin images and symptoms and obtaining disease predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Virtualenv (recommended)

## Installation
1.Clone the Repository <br /> git clone **https://github.com/dnavya09/skin_disease.git**
 <br /><br />
